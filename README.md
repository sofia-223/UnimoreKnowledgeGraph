This paper presents an analysis of the thematic critical mass within the publication network of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UNIMORE). The study aims to evaluate the university’s research activity across different areas by measuring the number of publications, involved researchers, interdisciplinarity, collaboration patterns. The findings provide insights into the university’s strong research domains and suggest potential directions for internal and external collaborations. The analysis establishes a foundation for further investigation, including measuring interdisciplinarity, evaluating author networks, and assessing scientific impact, which will enable a comprehensive understanding of UNIMORE’s thematic strengths.
